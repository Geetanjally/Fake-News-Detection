# Fake News Detection
## 📰 Project Overview 

This project aims to build a deep learning model that can automatically detect whether a news article is real or fake. The dataset contains both true and fake news, which is cleaned using tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. The processed text is then converted into numerical sequences using tokenization and padding. An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is trained to learn the patterns in the text and classify news accurately. The model achieved high accuracy during testing. It can be easily deployed to check the authenticity of any news in real time. This project showcases the use of NLP and deep learning to tackle misinformation online.
